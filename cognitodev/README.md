# A serverless developer authentication API
This is a quick serverless backend authentication API written in Java and deployed on Lambda. It uses DynamoDb to store user information and integrates with API Gateway to form the API. As the solution is serverless, its advantage is very obvious that you don't have to manage any server and the whole architect can scale automatically.

This project is based on AWS BJS region.

The client for this API can be found at [Github](https://github.com/xfsnow/android/tree/master/CognitoBjs).
